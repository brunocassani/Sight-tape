# Sight-tape

Prototype of a PDF maker with bow specs to be inputted directly into the files. This is the pre-GUI design. It is functional, albeit not easy.

# Compatibility
The project can be used as-is on MacOS with access to Terminal by running the .py file.\
**Warning:** You might need to change data on the `Trajectory.cpp`, `report.py`, and `setup.txt` for it to be funcional for your own purposes.
